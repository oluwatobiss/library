## Library App

This Library App provides users a handy way to record books they want to 
read, the ones they are currently reading, and those they have read.

The library provides interfaces that make it easy to:
* add books, 
* change read status,
* search the library, and
* delete books.

Feel free to [use the app here](https://oluwatobiss.github.io/library/).

training at The Odin Project.
